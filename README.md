# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to BitDevs Mauritius ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡º ðŸŒ´ a community of builders, developers, and curious minds on the island exploring the research and development of Bitcoin and related open-source technologies.

# Socratic Seminars ðŸ§ 
We host monthly Socratic-style meetups designed to spark thoughtful discussions, share insights, and deepen understanding of Bitcoin from its core technology to Layer 2 innovations like the Lightning Network.

In the weeks leading up to each event, members help curate discussion topics from pull requests, technical papers, developer blogs, and open-source repositories. During the meetup, participants present projects, research, and ideas, followed by open Q&A and networking.

After each session, we often continue the conversation over good food and island vibes ðŸŒ´ðŸ’¬
